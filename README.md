# medical_specialist_appointment_system

Project scanario:

Heroes polyclinic is a private clinic that 
specializes in providing medical services to 
different patients such as dental, 
blood pressure, child care, and heart diseases.
Currently the clinic uses manual system in 
providing services to their customers. 
The manual process has some problems like loss 
of resource and time consuming, management of 
customers, corruption, and dishonest among 
some staffs. To overcome the mentioned 
challenges, we proposed computerized 
information system that will help the clinic
to register the patients and staffs, 
the registered patients will be able to 
make appointment to the doctors of their 
choice, and the system generate reports of 
all the clinic activities for decision making
purposes by the management.
